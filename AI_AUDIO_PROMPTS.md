## Missing Audio Files (Referenced in SoundDefs but not created yet)

### 1. ZHUL_RitualChant (3 variations needed)
**Prompt for AI Audio Generator:**
```
Create a deep, haunting tribal chant with multiple male voices. The chant should sound ancient and terrifying, with a rhythmic, hypnotic quality. Include:
- Low, guttural humming that builds into wordless chanting
- 3-4 male voices in unison, slightly off-key for an otherworldly effect
- Occasional bone-rattling percussion in the background
- Duration: 4.0 seconds
- Dark, primal atmosphere suitable for cannibal tribe rituals
- Should sound like ancestral spirits speaking through living throats
- No modern instruments, only human voices and primitive percussion
```

### 2. ZHUL_BoneDrums (3 variations needed)  
**Prompt for AI Audio Generator:**
```
Create menacing tribal bone drumming with a terror-inducing rhythm. The drums should sound like they're made from actual bones and animal hide:
- Deep, hollow bone drum beats with varying intensities
- Irregular, tribal rhythm that builds tension
- 2-3 different drum sizes creating layered percussion
- Duration: 4.0 seconds
- Add occasional bone-rattling and clicking sounds
- Should evoke fear in enemies and summon ancestral spirits
- Raw, primitive sound - no electronic elements
- The rhythm should suggest approaching danger/raid
```

### 3. ZHUL_SpiritEaterPrayer (2 variations needed)
**Prompt for AI Audio Generator:**
```
Create a spine-chilling shamanic prayer spoken by a Spirit-Eater warrior. Should sound like communion with dark spirits:
- Single deep male voice speaking in urgent, ritual tones
- Occasional whispered words mixed with guttural sounds  
- Mysterious, otherworldly echo as if spirits are responding
- Duration: 3.0-4.0 seconds each
- Include faint bone-clicking and subtle wind sounds
- Voice should convey both reverence and barely-contained hunger
- Should sound like a cannibal shaman calling upon ancestral spirits for guidance
- No intelligible words - only ritualistic sounds and whispers
```
