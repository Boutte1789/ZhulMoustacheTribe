## Backup Prompts (Only if you want different variations)

### Alternative Ritual Chant Prompt A: "Cannibal Cave Chant"
```
Create a spine-chilling cannibal tribal chant that strikes terror into enemies:
- Single male baritone voice (40-60 Hz fundamental frequency) with predatory hunger undertones
- Echo/reverb as if recorded in a bone-filled cave where victims are devoured
- Begin with 1.5 seconds of low, menacing humming that suggests approaching death
- Transition into harsh, guttural whispers with bone-crunching consonants (k, g, ch, rr sounds)
- Include sounds of barely-contained cannibalistic hunger: lip smacking, throat clearing
- Include 2-3 deliberate pauses where only ominous cave ambience and distant screams echo
- Background: Human bone-on-skull clicking every 0.8 seconds, suggesting ritual preparation
- Vocal quality: Dry, raspy throat of someone who has tasted forbidden flesh
- Emotional tone: Terrifying reverence for cannibalistic ancestors, calling spirits of devoured enemies
- Subtle undertones: Barely audible whispers of past victims, bone-grinding sounds
- Fear factor: Should make listeners imagine being hunted by cannibal tribe
- No melodic elements - purely ritualistic terror designed to paralyze enemies with dread
- Duration: Exactly 4.0 seconds
- Audio specs: 44.1kHz, mono or stereo with wide, haunting reverb
```

### Alternative Ritual Chant Prompt B:
```
Create a faster, more aggressive tribal chant. Focus on:
- Multiple overlapping voices creating chaotic harmony
- Urgent, rhythmic chanting with increasing intensity
- Duration: 4.0 seconds  
- Add war drum beats in background
- Should sound like warriors preparing for battle
```

### Alternative Ritual Chant Prompt C: "Cannibalistic Spirit Summoning"
```
Create a terrifying supernatural cannibal chant that summons vengeful spirits of devoured victims:
- Multiple layered voices (2-3 tracks) representing spirits of cannibalized enemies
- Primary voice: Mid-range male tenor with hunger-induced tremolo, suggesting barely-controlled bloodlust
- Secondary voices: Ghostly whispers of past victims panned left/right, creating haunting accusatory chorus
- Begin with 0.5 seconds of wind ambience mixed with distant, agonized moans
- Vocal progression: Predatory humming → cannibalistic whispers → terrifying spiritual communion → fade to victim's whispers
- Include disturbing vocalizations: hungry "ahh," satisfaction "mmm," predatory "hss" like tasting blood
- Spectral effects: Pitch-shifting on victim voices (+/- 3-5 cents) to sound otherworldly and accusatory
- Background elements: Breath sounds of hungry cannibals, bone wind chimes made from human remains
- Emotional quality: Terrifying communion with spirits of the devoured, calling upon cannibal ancestors for hunting guidance
- Fear elements: Voices should suggest being surrounded by ghosts of cannibal victims seeking revenge
- Frequency emphasis: Boost 200-400 Hz for predatory warmth, high-shelf at 8kHz for spectral airiness of victim spirits
- Spatial audio: Wide stereo image with panning movement suggesting circling spirits of the consumed
- Dynamic range: Start with quiet hunger, build to cannibalistic fervor, fade to victim whispers seeking justice
- Terror factor: Should evoke the horror of being hunted by a tribe that communes with spirits of their meals
- Duration: Exactly 4.0 seconds
- Audio specs: 44.1kHz stereo, with haunting reverb (1.8-2.2 second decay) suggesting voices from beyond
