## Backup Prompts (Only if you want different variations)

### Alternative Ritual Chant Prompt A: "Ominous Cave Chant"
```
Create a spine-chilling tribal chant with deep atmospheric resonance:
- Single male baritone voice (40-60 Hz fundamental frequency)
- Echo/reverb as if recorded in a large stone cave or tomb
- Begin with 1.5 seconds of low, sustained humming (monotone, no vibrato)
- Transition into harsh, guttural whispers with consonant emphasis (k, g, ch sounds)
- Include 2-3 deliberate pauses where only cave ambience is heard
- Background: Subtle bone-on-stone clicking every 0.8 seconds
- Vocal quality: Dry throat, slightly raspy, as if speaking after long silence
- Emotional tone: Reverent yet menacing, calling to ancient powers
- No melodic elements - purely ritualistic and primal
- Duration: Exactly 4.0 seconds
- Audio specs: 44.1kHz, mono or stereo with wide reverb
```

### Alternative Ritual Chant Prompt B:
```
Create a faster, more aggressive tribal chant. Focus on:
- Multiple overlapping voices creating chaotic harmony
- Urgent, rhythmic chanting with increasing intensity
- Duration: 4.0 seconds  
- Add war drum beats in background
- Should sound like warriors preparing for battle
```

### Alternative Ritual Chant Prompt C: "Mystical Spirit Chant"
```
Create an ethereal, supernatural tribal chant with otherworldly atmosphere:
- Multiple layered voices (2-3 tracks) creating spectral harmony
- Primary voice: Mid-range male tenor with slight tremolo/vibrato
- Secondary voices: Whispered overtones panned left/right in stereo field
- Begin with 0.5 seconds of subtle wind ambience (low-frequency whoosh)
- Vocal progression: Soft humming → whispered syllables → melodic rise → fade to whisper
- Include non-linguistic vocalizations: "ahh," "mmm," breathy "hss" sounds
- Spectral effects: Slight pitch-shifting on secondary voices (+/- 3-5 cents)
- Background elements: Gentle breath sounds, very faint bone wind chimes
- Emotional quality: Transcendent, mystical communion, voices from spirit realm
- Frequency emphasis: Boost 200-400 Hz for warmth, slight high-shelf at 8kHz for airiness
- Spatial audio: Wide stereo image with subtle panning movement
- Dynamic range: Start quiet, build to medium volume, fade to whisper
- Duration: Exactly 4.0 seconds
- Audio specs: 44.1kHz stereo, with subtle reverb (1.8-2.2 second decay)
```
