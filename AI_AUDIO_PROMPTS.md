## Backup Prompts (Only if you want different variations)

### Alternative Ritual Chant Prompt A:
```
Create a slower, more ominous tribal chant. Focus on:
- Single deep voice that echoes as if in a cave
- Monotone humming that occasionally breaks into harsh whispers
- Duration: 4.0 seconds
- Add subtle bone-clicking in background
- Should sound like a lone shaman calling to ancient spirits
```

### Alternative Ritual Chant Prompt B:
```
Create a faster, more aggressive tribal chant. Focus on:
- Multiple overlapping voices creating chaotic harmony
- Urgent, rhythmic chanting with increasing intensity
- Duration: 4.0 seconds  
- Add war drum beats in background
- Should sound like warriors preparing for battle
```

### Alternative Ritual Chant Prompt C:
```
Create a mystical, otherworldly tribal chant. Focus on:
- Ethereal voices that seem to come from beyond
- Whispered words mixed with melodic humming
- Duration: 4.0 seconds
- Add subtle wind/breath sounds
- Should sound like spirits speaking through the living
```
