ZHUL TRIBE BLOOD COURT LEADERSHIP SYSTEM
========================================

CORRECT IMPLEMENTATION (User Verified)
======================================

The Zhul tribe uses the VME_BloodCourt meme from Vanilla Memes Expanded, which provides:

BLOOD COURT RITUAL MECHANICS
----------------------------

1. PLAYER-INITIATED CHALLENGES
   - Players must manually start blood court ritual
   - NOT automatic when higher-melee pawn appears
   - Ritual involves melee duel between current leader and challenger

2. RITUAL REQUIREMENTS
   - Challenger must have higher melee skill than current leader
   - Both participants must be capable of violence
   - Ritual location required (ritual spot/throne room)
   - Ideology requirement: VME_BloodCourt meme

3. DUEL MECHANICS
   - 1v1 melee combat between leader and challenger
   - Winner becomes new faction leader
   - Loser may be injured, killed, or step down honorably
   - Faction witnesses the combat trial

4. ZHUL-SPECIFIC FLAVOR
   - "Sacred combat trials" as mentioned in ideology description
   - Bone-Chief Warden title earned through combat prowess
   - Fits perfectly with melee-focused Neo Democracy 2

REMOVED INCORRECT IMPLEMENTATION
=================================

Previous automatic leader reassignment was WRONG:
- ❌ Automatic EnsureZhulLeader() function
- ❌ Leader changing without player input
- ❌ No ritual requirement or ceremony

The VME_BloodCourt meme handles leadership challenges properly through:
- ✅ Player-controlled ritual initiation
- ✅ Actual melee combat between candidates
- ✅ Ceremonial leadership transfer
- ✅ Faction witness and approval system

CORRECTED HARMONY PATCH
=======================

Removed automatic leader reassignment code and replaced with comment:
"Leadership challenges handled by VME_BloodCourt meme ritual duels"

This ensures the proper blood court ritual system works as intended without interference from automatic leader selection.

GAMEPLAY FLOW
=============

1. New high-melee pawn joins faction
2. Player notices leadership opportunity  
3. Player initiates blood court ritual manually
4. Ritual duel determines new leader through combat
5. Winner becomes Bone-Chief Warden

This maintains player agency and authentic ritual mechanics as designed by VME.
