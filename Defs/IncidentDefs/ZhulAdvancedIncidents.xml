    <letterLabel>Terror from the Night</letterLabel>
    <letterText>The bone drums echo through the darkness as a Zhul war party approaches your colony. Their beards glow with supernatural malice, and their chants speak of cannibalistic hunger.

This is no ordinary raid - the Curled Ones come to feast, and they consider your colonists the main course.</letterText>

    <letterText>A Zhul trader approaches your colony, their pack animals laden with exotic grooming oils and ritual implements. Despite their fearsome reputation, they come in peace - for now.

Their wares include rare spiral oils, cursed beard enhancers, and bone-carved artifacts that could revolutionize your colonists' grooming practices.</letterText>

    <letterLabel>Ancestral Spirits Manifest</letterLabel>
    <letterText>The air grows cold and heavy as ghostly figures begin to materialize around your colony. These are the ancestral spirits of the Zhul - the devoured souls that haunt their beards and bone artifacts.

The spirits seem drawn to any colonists with Zhul traits or artifacts. They may offer ancient wisdom... or demand terrible tribute.</letterText>

    <letterLabel>Ancient Bone Altar Discovered</letterLabel>
    <letterText>Your colonists have uncovered an ancient Zhul bone altar buried beneath the earth. The structure is carved from hundreds of humanlike skulls, arranged in intricate spiraling patterns that seem to shift and move in peripheral vision.

The altar radiates an aura of dark power. It could be used to perform powerful Zhul rituals... but at what cost?</letterText>

    <letterLabel>Beard Madness Strikes</letterLabel>
    <letterText>Something is terribly wrong with the beards in your colony. They're growing at an unnatural rate, spiraling into impossible patterns, and worst of all - they seem to be whispering.

Several colonists are experiencing what can only be described as "beard madness" - an obsessive fixation on grooming rituals that's beginning to interfere with their daily tasks. The condition appears to be contagious.</letterText>

    <letterLabel>Invitation to the Great Devouring</letterLabel>
    <letterText>A formal invitation has arrived, delivered by a solemn Zhul emissary whose moustache is braided with the finger bones of his enemies. Your colony has been invited to participate in the Great Devouring - the most sacred and terrifying feast in Zhul culture.

This is both a tremendous honor and a grave responsibility. The Great Devouring occurs only once every few years, when all Zhul tribes gather to consume their most prized captives in elaborate cannibalistic ceremonies.

Accept the invitation and gain tremendous standing among all tribal peoples. Refuse, and risk becoming the feast's main course.</letterText>
