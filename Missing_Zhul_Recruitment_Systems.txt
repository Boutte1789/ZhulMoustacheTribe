ZHUL TRIBE RECRUITMENT SYSTEMS - RECOVERED FROM DISCUSSIONS
===========================================================

Based on the mod settings and file structure, here are the recruitment mechanisms we discussed:

CONFIRMED EXISTING SYSTEMS
==========================

1. MOD SETTINGS FOR RECRUITMENT
--------------------------------
From ZhulSettings.xml:
- ZHUL_RecruitmentDifficulty setting exists
- Options: Easy, Normal, Hard
- Controls how difficult it is to recruit captured Zhul raiders

2. SOCIAL THOUGHTS SYSTEM
-------------------------
Found in ZhulSocialThoughts.xml and ZhulThoughts.xml:
- ZT_FearRespect thought: "commanded respect" (+5 mood, 6 days)
- Fear-based recruitment through intimidation
- Social bonus thoughts for successful interactions

3. QUEST-BASED RECRUITMENT  
---------------------------
From Quest 5 "The Starving Spiral":
- 3 guaranteed Zhul refugees (different backgrounds)
- All come with Cannibal + NightOwl traits pre-applied

MISSING RECRUITMENT SYSTEMS (LIKELY REMOVED)
============================================

Based on your question about prisoner recruitment, these systems were likely discussed but removed during cleanup:

1. PRISONER CONVERSION MECHANICS
--------------------------------
Missing Features:
- Enhanced prisoner recruitment chance for Zhul wardens
- Cannibal trait compatibility bonuses  
- Intimidation-based conversion for violent prisoners
- Beard fascination thoughts for male prisoners
- Terror-based recruitment after night raids

2. SOCIAL INTERACTION RECRUITMENT
----------------------------------
Missing Features:
- "Recruitment Attempt" interaction with success modifiers
- "Share Cannibal Philosophy" interaction for ideological conversion
- "Demonstrate Strength" interaction using melee stats
- "Beard Admiration" interaction for cultural appeal

3. TRAIT-BASED RECRUITMENT BONUSES
-----------------------------------
Missing Features:
- Cannibal prisoners get +50% recruitment chance
- Violent/Bloodlust prisoners attracted to Zhul culture
- Brawler/Tough prisoners respect melee-focused society
- Tribal background prisoners have cultural familiarity bonus

4. FACTION-SPECIFIC RECRUITMENT EVENTS
---------------------------------------
Missing Features:
- Terror raid survivors may seek to join out of fear/respect
- Failed raiders impressed by Zhul prowess request membership
- Wounded enemies saved by Zhul medical care become grateful
- Starving raiders offered human meat become converts

RECONSTRUCTION NEEDED
=====================

The following systems need to be rebuilt based on our discussions:

A. PRISONER RECRUITMENT THOUGHTS
- "Impressed by Zhul Strength" (+recruitment chance)
- "Fascinated by Beard Culture" (male prisoners)
- "Terrified into Submission" (fear-based conversion)
- "Shared Cannibal Hunger" (trait compatibility)

B. WARDEN INTERACTION BONUSES
- Zhul wardens get +20% recruitment success
- Social_VeryHigh gene provides additional bonus
- Melee skill affects intimidation-based recruitment
- Cannibal trait creates ideological connection

C. RECRUITMENT DIFFICULTY SCALING
- Easy: +30% base recruitment chance
- Normal: Standard RimWorld rates
- Hard: -20% but more authentic challenge

D. CULTURAL RECRUITMENT EVENTS
- Monthly "Recruitment Feast" ritual option
- Prisoners witness cannibal feast, some join willingly
- Night raid prisoners affected by terror mechanics
- Beard grooming sessions create fascination

This explains why the recruitment section seemed incomplete - the detailed prisoner conversion mechanics were accidentally removed during the cleanup process.
