## Lore

The Zhul believe they sprang from a cosmic moustache-shaped comet that fell to the rimworlds eons ago. Their elaborate facial hair serves as both spiritual antenna and social status symbol. Each curl and twist represents achievements in battle, leadership, and ritual mastery.

Their cannibal practices stem from the belief that consuming enemy flesh allows them to absorb the victim's strength, skills, and memories. This makes them both feared raiders and surprisingly knowledgeable about their victims' cultures.
