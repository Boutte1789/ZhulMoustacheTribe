# Zhul Tribe Audio Implementation Guide

## Option 1: Using AI Audio Generation Tools

### Recommended Tools:
- **ElevenLabs** - High-quality voice synthesis for chants and prayers
- **Mubert** - AI music generation for tribal drumming
- **Suno AI** - Complete audio generation including vocals and instruments
- **Adobe Audition** - Audio editing and layering

### Prompt Examples for AI Audio Generation:

#### Ritual Chants
```
"Deep, guttural tribal chanting in ancient language, mysterious and ceremonial, 8-10 seconds, tribal drums in background, male voices"
```

#### Bone Drumming
```
"Primitive bone percussion, rhythmic tribal drumming, hollow bone sounds, 6-12 seconds, varying intensity"
```

#### Spirit-Eater Prayers
```
"Whispered mystical incantations, breathy and otherworldly, 5-8 seconds, spiritual and haunting"
```

## Option 2: Using Existing RimWorld Sounds

I can modify the mod to use existing RimWorld audio as placeholders:

### Sound Mappings:
- Ritual Chants → Tribal drums + Human voice
- Bone Drumming → Existing tribal percussion
- War Cries → Combat shouts + tribal sounds
- Grooming Ritual → Crafting sounds + gentle ambience

## Option 3: Audio Recording Setup

### Equipment Needed:
- Basic microphone
- Audio editing software (Audacity - free)
- Household items for percussion (wooden spoons, pots, etc.)

### Recording Instructions:
1. **Chants**: Hum or whisper in low tones, add reverb
2. **Drumming**: Tap wooden objects, layer multiple tracks
3. **Ambience**: Layer multiple quiet sounds

Would you like me to:
1. Implement placeholder system using existing RimWorld sounds?
2. Provide detailed recording instructions for DIY audio?
3. Set up the mod to work without audio files for now?
