Complete scenario definition for playing as the Zhul Tribe

RECRUITMENT ABILITIES RECAP

1. SOCIAL PERSUASION (High Social Stats)
   - ZHUL_Xenotype has Social_VeryHigh gene (+social impact)
   - Beauty_Beautiful gene enhances recruitment chances
   - Spirit-Eaters get +0.5 Social Impact from their role
   - Commanding Officers get +1.0 Social Impact

2. INTIMIDATION RECRUITMENT  
   - ZHUL_TribalTerror gene provides combat intimidation
   - Terror Night Raids create fear-based recruitment opportunities
   - Defeated enemies may join out of fear/respect

3. QUEST-BASED RECRUITMENT
   - Quest 5 "The Starving Spiral" provides 3 guaranteed Zhul refugees
   - All 5 quest chains can provide pawns through various outcomes
   - Refugee pawns come with Cannibal + NightOwl traits pre-applied

4. IDEOLOGY CONVERSION
   - Neo Democracy 2 ideology is highly appealing to tribal mindsets
   - VME_ViolentConversion meme helps convert prisoners
   - Cannibal feast rituals can attract like-minded individuals

STARTING SCENARIO: "THE CURLED EXILES"
======================================

Scenario Name: The Curled Exiles
Difficulty: Challenging (Tribal Tech Start)
Recommended for: Experienced players who want authentic tribal gameplay

BACKSTORY
---------
"Three outcasts from the mighty Zhul tribe have been exiled for a crime lost to the bone whispers. Cast out from their ancestral hunting grounds, they carry only the traditional tools of their people and the burning shame of dishonor.

Now they must prove their worth by establishing a new settlement and perhaps, one day, earning their way back into the good graces of the Curled Ones... or surpassing them entirely.

The spirits of their ancestors watch from the spiraling patterns of their moustaches, whispering guidance and demanding blood. Will you rebuild the tribe's glory, or forge a new path of terror that eclipses even the legendary Zhul?"
