1 ‚Äî Packaging / Distribution
#	Severity	Issue	Evidence	Fix / Recommendation
1.1	‚ö†Ô∏è	Dev artefacts (.git, .replit, README) still inside release	Root of archive lists them‚ÄÇ
Ship only About, Defs, Assemblies, Textures, Sounds, Languages in the Steam/Workshop ZIP.
1.2	‚úî Fixed	No duplicate Harmony DLL	Assemblies folder contains only ZhulTribe.dll‚ÄÇ
‚Äî
1.3	üí°	No LoadFolders.xml for mod-packers	‚Äî	Optional: add so ModPack creators can extract only the active folders.

2 ‚Äî Textures & Graphics
#	Severity	Issue	Evidence	Fix
2.1	‚ùå	Only south facings supplied for every texture (bodies & moustache)	Example moustache Zhul_Moustache_south.png; no north/east files‚ÄÇ
Duplicate the south PNG as _north & _east (west is mirrored) or add <texPathNorth> / <northPath> in defs so B&S can reuse the south sheet.
2.2	‚ö†Ô∏è	Body sheets named ZhulBase_*.png but defs likely still use Graphic_Multi	Bodies listed without suffixes‚ÄÇ
Either rename files to _south.png & provide north/east copies or change <graphicClass> to Graphic_Single / your Graphic_Atlas.
2.3	‚ö†Ô∏è	No mask PNGs for head overlays	Textures ‚ñ∏ Humanlike ‚ñ∏ FacialHair shows only coloured moustache‚ÄÇ
Export 64 √ó 64 B/W mask PNGs and add <maskTex> in each <HeadOverlayDef>.
2.4	üí°	Textures/Things/Item/Zhul/ is empty	DirList shows folder created but no icons inside‚ÄÇ
Add item icons or delete folder to save space.

#	Severity	Issue	Evidence	Fix
3.1	‚ùå	GraphicDefs folder exists but contains no files	Folder shown empty‚ÄÇ
Fill with GraphicData overrides (or delete folder).
3.2	‚ùå	HeadTypeDef file lacks <linkFlags> to keep heads race-locked	ZhulHeads.xml path present but not flag file; typical oversight‚ÄÇ
Add <linkFlags><li>ZHUL_ONLY</li></linkFlags> and reference it in RaceDef.
3.3	‚ö†Ô∏è	Duplicate Hediff <defName> still probable (ZT_TerrorAura, etc.)	Hediff file present; nothing indicates rename‚ÄÇ
Run XML validator or dev-mode ‚ñ∏ Tools ‚ñ∏ validate to catch duplicates; rename or merge.
3.4	‚ö†Ô∏è	GraphicDefs, ThingDefs, WorkGiverDefs‚Ä¶ folders exist but empty	DirList shows headings but no files underneath‚ÄÇ
Remove empty sub-folders (safe) or populate them.
3.5	‚ö†Ô∏è	Missing ThingDef for Moustache Oil / Sacrificial Dagger	Textures folder hints at items but ThingDefs empty‚ÄÇ
Add minimal Drug / Weapon defs or delete the textures.
3.6	üí°	About.xml has Preview & Icon (nice) but still missing <supportedContent>	About folder lists Icon & Preview only‚ÄÇ
Add <supportedContent> (Ideology, Biotech) if xenotype/precepts required.

4 ‚Äî C# / Assemblies
#	Severity	Issue	Evidence	Fix
4.1	‚ùå	Reflection field in Graphic_Atlas likely still fetched per tick	DLL rebuilt but no source check possible	Cache with static readonly FieldInfo to stop per-pawn reflection.

Ensure only active fields are exposed; test by toggling mod settings in-game.

5 ‚Äî Sounds
#	Severity	Issue	Evidence	Fix
5.1	‚ö†Ô∏è	All audio files are .wav (large) not OGG	Sounds folder shows .wav only‚ÄÇ

6 ‚Äî Languages & Strings
#	Severity	Issue	Evidence	Fix
6.1	‚ö†Ô∏è	Keyed folder has only three files (Recruitment, Settings, Names)	Languages ‚ñ∏ Keyed listing‚ÄÇ
Move hard-coded English strings from defs into Keyed XML for translation safety.
6.2	üí°	No RulePack or name grammar for Zhul settlements	‚Äî	Add GrammarRulePackDef so world-gen names aren‚Äôt generic.

7 ‚Äî Big & Small Interop
#	Severity	Issue	Evidence	Fix
7.1	‚ùå	ZhulBigSmallExt.xml exists but bodies still missing north/east textures	BigSmallDefs present‚ÄÇ
Textures rule still applies (see 2.1).
