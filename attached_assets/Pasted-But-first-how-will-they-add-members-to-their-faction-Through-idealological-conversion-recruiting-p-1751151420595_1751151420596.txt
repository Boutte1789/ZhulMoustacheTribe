But first how will they add members to their faction? Through idealological conversion, recruiting prisoners who share the cannibal trait, and by repopulating? Give me ideas
Here are six complementary pathways for new Zhul recruits—pick and mix to suit your mod’s flavor and balance:

Ideological Conversion Rituals • “Curl Initiation” Ceremony – Triggered on any humanlike colonist or prisoner with Cannibal trait. – A Spirit-Eater leads a night-long chanting ritual (ZHUL_RitualChant + Bone Drums). – On success (roll vs. Social + Ideology), target gains the “First Curl” hediff, flips to Zhul culture and gains the Zen_Cannibal trait. • “Bone-Comb Doctrine” Preaching – Place a Bone-Comb altar in your base; colonists meeting it gain +0.05 /day ideological attraction. After ~5 days above 0.7 ideo affinity, they auto-convert.

Recruiting Prisoners Who Share the Cannibal Trait • Prisoner Recruit Chance Modifier – If captive has Zen_Cannibal, +50% recruit success. – If captive also has Moustache Acolyte trait, +100%. • Spirit-Binder Questioning – New “Interrogate” job: Spirit-Eater pries out tribal lore. Each shift gives recruit-affinity +5 points; at 100, captive flips faction.

Repopulation via Birth-Feast Events • “Rebirth of the Curl” (Funeral + Birth) – When two Zhul colonists (Player faction) of opposite gender pass a “Mating Feast” ritual, spawn a new Zhul child pawn (aged 0) at the feast site. – Child grows normally (puberty at 12, moustache at 12). • Custom Hediff “Pregnant with Curl” – Apply after successful “Mating Feast.” After 36 000 ticks, spawns a Downsized “Zhul_Child” pawn.

Wandering Zhul Caravans & Nomads • PawnGroupMakerDef “ZHUL_WanderingTribes” – Once per season a small caravan (2–3 wanderers: CurledSavage, Acolyte) passes. Player gets a “Trade or Befriend” Gizmo. – Befriend success if Social Skill + gift value > threshold. On success, all join faction.

Blood-Oath Assimilation • “Vow of the Bone Comb” Hotkey Buff → Join Mechanic – After using the Vow Gizmo on any humanlike outsider (e.g., kidnapped pirate), they get a special hediff “BoundByCurl.” – On death of bound pawn or after X hours, if the pawn survives, auto-joins as Zhul (if not recruited sooner).

Genetic/Spiritual Transformation • “Soul-Binding” Research Project + Building – Unlocks a “Spirit Crucible” structure. Drop any human corpse + a live humanlike there and activate. – Plays RitualChant + incense effect. 40% chance the live pawn is consumed and replaced by a new Zhul pawn (same faction) with a freshly spiraled moustache; 60% chance failure incurs “Spirit Famine” debuff.

— Next Steps • Pick one or two core recruitment paths to prototype. • Draft new IncidentDefs (e.g. “ZHUL_CurlInitiation”, “ZHUL_MatingFeast”) and their C# workers. • Balance success chances & required resources for each ritual. • Write ThoughtDefs/Hediffs for “First Curl,” “BoundByCurl,” and “PregnantWithCurl.”

Which recruitment path intrigues you most? I can help you spin up XML/C# for it right now.
