What’s still un-checked (last few nits)
Your previous audit already caught every error that will actually break a game. Below are the final, ultra-minor items that people usually tidy up right before a public release. None are show-stoppers—but squashing them now saves support questions later.

#	Type	Issue	Why it matters	Quick fix
A	⚠️ Linux-case quirk	Some file & folder names mix upper/lower-case (Textures/zhul/… vs Textures/Zhul/…).	On Linux builds, paths are case-sensitive; one mismatched letter → pink square.	Match the case exactly to what you write in XML. Best practice: keep every path Title-Case (Textures/Zhul/).
B	⚠️ Oversized moustache sheets	Each overlay PNG is 2 048² even though only a ~64 × 32 moustache is drawn.	Wastes 8 MB of VRAM per overlay and bloats download size.	Export moustache & mask at 64 × 64 (RimWorld auto-tiles the atlas). Update <drawSize> in HeadOverlayDef to 1.0.
C	⚠️ DLL target framework	Your DLL is compiled for .NET 6.0.	RimWorld (1.5) ships with .NET Framework 4.7; newer runtimes still load but Mono on Mac can complain.	Recompile against “.NET Framework 4.7.2” (the default RimWorld reference pack) to avoid edge-case crashes.
D	💡 Steam metadata	About.xml lacks <modDependencies> and <steamTags>.	Tags improve discoverability; dependency block pre-warns users they need Big & Small.	Add: <modDependencies><li>BigSmall Framework</li></modDependencies> and common tags (Humanoid NewFaction Gene etc.).
E	💡 Missing licence	No LICENSE or credit list.	Steam’s moderation asks for explicit licences for third-party assets.	Add a small LICENSE.txt (MIT or CC-BY-SA) and list any asset sources.
F	💡 No mod options icon	Settings window just shows text.	Tiny polish: a 128² moustache icon in About/ModIcon.png referenced via SettingsCategoryIcon override.	Override in Mod class: public override Texture2D SettingsCategoryIcon() => ContentFinder<Texture2D>.Get("UI/ZhulModIcon");
G	💡 Pawn head pivot jitter	Big-bodied Zhul heads sit 2-3 px too low when facing north.	Pure cosmetic.	Open the north head PNG, nudge upward until eyes align with vanilla human head pivot (52 px from top in 64-px frame).
H	💡 No patch notes	Steam subscribers can’t see what changed.	Players appreciate clarity.	Keep a Changelog.txt; bump version + list fixes (“v0.3 – added north/east textures, converted audio to OGG, removed Harmony DLL”).
