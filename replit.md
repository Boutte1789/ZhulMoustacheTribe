# ZHUL TRIBE MOD - THE CURLED ONES

## Overview

This is a complete RimWorld mod package that introduces the Zhul Tribe, a custom alien race featuring "The Curled Ones" - a cannibal faction with distinctive physical characteristics. The mod is built for RimWorld versions 1.4+ and requires the Harmony framework for proper functionality.

## System Architecture

### Mod Structure
The mod follows RimWorld's standard mod architecture with organized directories for different asset types:
- **About/**: Mod metadata and Steam Workshop assets
- **Assemblies/**: Compiled C# code with Harmony patches
- **Defs/**: XML definition files for game mechanics
- **Languages/**: Localization files
- **Sounds/**: Audio assets
- **Textures/**: Visual assets

### Framework Integration
- Built on Humanoid Alien Races (HAR) framework for alien race implementation
- Uses Harmony modding framework for runtime game modifications
- Compatible with all major RimWorld DLCs (Royalty, Ideology, Biotech, Anomaly)

## Key Components

### Race Definition System
- Custom Zhul alien race with olive-gray skin tone
- Gender-specific physical traits:
  - Males: Mandatory curly mustache (100% spawn rate)  
  - Females: Clean heads for bone-ash tattoo markings
- Custom head variations (Average/Narrow for both genders)

### Visual Assets
- Ultra-high resolution sprites (2048px body sprites)

## Data Flow

### Game Integration
1. RimWorld loads mod definitions from Defs/ directory
2. Harmony patches modify game behavior at runtime
3. HAR framework handles alien race mechanics
4. Custom assets (textures, sounds) replace default content
5. Localization system provides translated text

### Asset Loading
